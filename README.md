PandaViewLibrary
================

The aim of the PandaView project is to create a user-freindly Java library which can create anything from a simple UI to an in-Depth 2D game (think as cool as LoL). 

As of now, PandaView will use JFrames and JPanels from Java Swing and numerous Elements from Java2D (*.awt). HOWEVER, this library will be much more than a simple swing overhaul. 

The initial step of PandaView is to make a code library that allows for largely image-based objects, as well as physics and listener oriented processing. This will allow for eye-popping UI's and compelling games. 

If you are familiar with GreenFoot, you may have an idea of what we are doing. PandaView, however will have key differences from GreenFoot. The initial Library may have certain classes that are reminiscient, but PandaView aims to be larger, more in-depth, faster, and easier to use than GreenFoot classes. 

The project will begin as an open-source framework. Once an open-source framework is estabilished,the possibility of a for-profit enhanced library will become available. Programs, games, utilities may also be created using the PandaViewLibrary, with those being probably for-profit.

At some point past the initial framework, we may try a Kickstarter. We will also develope a website around this time.

The project has a GitHub organization, as that will be our primary collobration network. Google accounts will also be used for Hangouts and Google Drive sharing.
